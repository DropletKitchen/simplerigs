** Introduction
Many droplet microfluidic experiments have simple imaging
requirements, for example as a real-time quality control to ensure
droplet generation is running smoothly. This page shows how to build
simple microscopes with inexpensive board cameras. Flipping the
objective of the camera transforms the setup to a small
microscope. Magnification of the system is dependent on the distance
between the objective and the CCD or CMOS chip of the camera. In
contrast to scientific cameras, inexpensive consumer electronics
cameras or board cameras do not offer much control. They usually
self-regulate exposure times depending on the light available and
without frame rate adjustment, binning, or camera-triggering is
possible. BUT - they are incredibly cheap and often offer surprising
performance. Here we use a PS3 Eye camera and a CCD-camera that
outputs analog PAL video used for First Person View (FPV) drone
flying. While the PS3 eye is a rolling shutter camera, the board CCD
camera is global shutter, which is well suited for imaging fast
events.

#+CAPTION: This image compilation shows the performance of both cameras for observing a simple microfluidic droplet generator. The PS3Eye camera shows distortion effects due to its rolling shutter, but still allows to estimate droplet monodispersity (by virtue of width) up to velocities of 400 mm/s. The Sony CCD global shutter board camera lacks distortions, and yields useful images at higher velocities. With global shutter cameras the lightsource can additionally be strobed to enhance image quality. Due to the different chip sensor-objective distances of the setups used (see image below), the images of the PS3Eye have higher magnification. In its 'fast mode', the PS3Eye has a resolution of 320x240 (up to 180 fps) and is connected via USB. The Emax Sony 811 outputs analog video (PAL, 25fps) with a resolution of 976x582 pixels. Video can be displayed directly on a monitor. To use the camera with a computer, a framegrabber is needed.

** Design
The model was first developed in openSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/)
and sliced for lasercutting
([[./files/RigSonyCCDPS3eyeBoardCameraOpenSCAD.scad]]). Later modifications
were done in a .dxf-file ([[./files/RigSonyCCDPS3eyeBoardCamera.dxf]]) with
Draftsight
(http://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/free-download/).
Starting with a 3D-model is helpful to play with overall dimensions
and shapes, but the design is quicker to modify in 2D-CAD at later
stages.

** Assembly
*** Optics
- disassemble the PS3 eye camera, you will have to remove some plastic
  on the objective (glued) to be able to flip it. The SonyCCD
  camera can be used as is, just remove the objective.

- attach the flipped objective to the camera in a way that no light
  can enter from the sides. This can either be done by clamping or
  glueing (see image below). If you want to improve magnification,
  enlarge the distance between camera-chip and objective by using a
  3D-printed tube or stack of acrylic rings. In this design
  adapter-plates were used that allow cameras to be easily exchanged. On the
  other hand they can also be just attached with some Sugru or hot
  melt glue.

*** Structure
Assembling the rig is straightforward; have a look at the image
above. Make sure that your components fit - if you change the design,
just measure components with a caliper and use exactly those
dimensions for holes etc. Laser cut parts usually results in a tight
fit. The camera with the inverted objective is held in place by
clamping it with acrylic sheets and M3 screws.

The stage is mounted on three optics screws with spherical ends in a
kinematic fashion - which defines the position of the stage by resting
on 6 points of contact. This is ideally 3 points on one, 2 on the
next, and one on the third. Here strong magnets are used to fix the
stage on its support - a ring magnet on the first side (a small cheat
but works well), 2 stacked disk magnets that magnetize two small steel
rods on top, and a stack of three disk magnets on the third point.
This assembly allows you not only to control z distance (focus), but
you can also tilt the stage and therefore have some movement in
x,y. For convenience, adding an inexpensive x,y stage is
recommended. They all differ a bit, so make sure you adapt the files
accordingly.

*** Light
For the lightsource, a star-shaped white high power LED is used which
is controlled by an adjustable LED driver. A M3 screw is used as a
heat sink and also holds the LED in place. The LED driver, a
potentiometer used to control brightness and an on/off switch is
soldered onto stripboard and then packaged in an acrylic enclosure. It
does not have to bear a lot of load, so the enclosure is based on cut
acrylic slides with double-sided tape added on one side before
cutting. This allows the structural components to be bonded together.
To focus the light of the LED onto the chip, inexpensive plastic
lenses are used. For assembly, just use a dab of epoxy glue. Do not
use 'Superglue', as cyanoacrylate vapours render optics components
cloudy over time.  Change the distance between LED and the stage such
that the image on the camera is overexposed when the LED is fully on
and the camera is set automatically to the smallest exposure time
possible. This allows you to get the best possible images of
fast-moving objects with your setup. Below is the circuit diagram for
wiring if you use the Recom LED-driver. If you want an on/off switch,
just wire it to the voltage or ground wire. Almost any power supply
will do (>=1A, 5-36V).
